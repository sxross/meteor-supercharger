  This version of the Tesla Superchargers Web app is completely free. The
  only thing we ask of you is that you use it. Your using it relays important
  information to your fellow Tesla owners and they can better plan their

  ## What Do You Do?

  When you get to a Supercharger, count the cars, compare them to what's up
  in the App and adjust it accordingly. Thus, your fellow drivers up the
  road will know what to expect.

  ## What Does the App Do (partial feature list)?

  It lets you take a pre-populated list of Superchargers, and choose the
  one you want. You can then view a couple of unique statistics about the
  charger. Basically, how many cars are there as of the last time some
  honest user of this app visited.

  In no particular order, here is the current feature list:

  * List of Tesla Superchargers, in order of country, complete
  with location, elevation and count of charging stall occupancy.
  * "Infinite" scroll. To keep from making your browser work like
  a 1990s version of Internet Explorer, only 5 results are downloaded
  at a time. This is in deference to the 3G connection of the Tesla.
  As you scroll, more results are loaded in. Resist the urge to scroll
  from top to bottom. There are a ton of Superchargers (thanks, Tesla)
  and you'll be there forever.
  * "Live" search. There is a search bar and if you type a few letters
  of the name of the Supercharger, you should find it just fine.
  * Link to Google Maps. If you click on the coordinates (in blue
  near the top of each tile), you will be taken to Google Maps and a
  location pin will mark the charger. You can get driving directions
  from there.

  ## FAQ

  ### Why do I need to log in?

  Only because it's preferable not to have bots partying on
  this kind of app. We don't know who you are. We don't track where you've been.
  Nothing private is required other than your email, which we don't associate with
  your locations. Privacy is important to us, so we ask as little as possible.

  What that means is that if you don't sign up, you can look, but you can't
  play. I.e., you can view, but can't change the counts of various aspects
  of the Superchargers
