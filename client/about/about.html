  This version of the Tesla Superchargers Web app is in alpha test. The
  only thing we ask of you is that you use it. Your using it relays important
  information to your fellow Tesla owners and they can better plan their
  charging stay.

  If you are unfamiliar with alpha and beta testing, they work like this:
  They are both pre-releases without some of the features fully formed. As
  a result, there may be bugs and inconsistencies. That's what the alpha
  and beta test periods are for.

  In this specific case, the alpha test is to find out how the Tesla
  community reacts to this app as a tool and tune it to serve everyone's
  needs. Beta test will be more of a bug finding period.

  ## What Do We Want You Do?

  When you get to a Supercharger, count the cars, compare them to what's up
  in the App and adjust it accordingly. Thus, your fellow drivers up the
  road will know what to expect.

  ## partial feature list?

  The Tesla Supercharger app lets you take a pre-populated list of
  Superchargers, and choose the one you want. You can then view a
  couple of unique statistics about the charger. Basically, how many
  cars are there as of the last time some honest user of this app visited.

  In no particular order, here is the current feature list:

  * List of Tesla Superchargers, in order of country, complete
  with location, elevation and count of charging stall occupancy.
  * "Infinite" scroll. To keep from making your browser work like
  a 1990s version of Internet Explorer, only 5 results are downloaded
  at a time. This is in deference to the 3G connection of the Tesla.
  As you scroll, more results are loaded in. Resist the urge to scroll
  from top to bottom. There are a ton of Superchargers (thanks, Tesla)
  and you'll be there forever.
  * "Live" search. There is a search bar and if you type a few letters
  of the name of the Supercharger, you should find it just fine.
  * Link to Google Maps. If you click on the coordinates (in blue
  near the top of each tile), you will be taken to Google Maps and a
  location pin will mark the charger. You can get driving directions
  from there.

## FAQ

  ### Why do I need to log in?

  Several reasons:

  * It's impossible to allow customizations for each user if you
    don't create a username.

  * It's preferable not to have bots partying on this kind of app.

  We don't know who you are. We don't track where you've been.
  Nothing private is required other than your email, which we don't associate with
  your locations. Privacy is important to us, so we ask your for as little as possible.

  What that means is that if you don't sign up, you can look, but you can't
  play. I.e., you can view, but can't change the counts of various aspects
  of the Superchargers. You also can't customize the app to show only the
  chargers you are interested in. More features requiring login will be
  in future releases.

  A personal note on creating accounts. I have as many different accounts as
  pretty much anyone with a whole slew of sites. I hate giving out personal
  information and immediately suspect any site that asks for these "magic
  cookies". While in alpha, feel free to **make up an email that does not
  have a valid TLD, so for example: me@domain.bogus**. We will allow you in
  during this period without the email verification of your user account.
