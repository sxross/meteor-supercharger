      This version of the Tesla Superchargers Web app is completely free. The
      only thing we ask of you is that you use it. Your using it relays important
      information to your fellow Tesla owners and they can better plan their
      stops at Superchargers.

      Only because it's preferable not to have bots partying on
      this kind of app. We don't know who you are. We don't track where you've been.
      Nothing private is required other than your email, which we don't associate with
      your locations. Privacy is important to us, so we ask as little as possible.

      You should. It's a natural and it's in the works. In the meantime, we ask
      that you poke along with the browser app in your Model S. The iPhone version
      will be ready first and will have really cool features:

      <ul>
        <li>Filterable list of chargers.</li>
        <li>Chargers color coded according to how fully-occupied they are.</li>
        <li>Location-aware -- knows the elevation differential between your current
          location and the charger's location; knows the distance (as the crow flies)
          between where you are now and where the charger is.</li>
        <li>Country-configurable -- you can display chargers in the country where
          you plan to travel only. After all, why display all the US chargers if
          you are driving the Autobahn?</li>
        <li>Routing-friendly -- if you want your phone to grab a route to the charger,
          it will. Even if you never follow the phone's route, you may want the actual
          routed distance, the directions, and a visual of the map. Not that you can't
          get it on the 17" display, but if you're waiting for your check in the restaurant
          and want to get the plan for your next leg, you're more likely to have your phone
          than your car handy.
        </li>
        <li>Unit-friendly -- not confined to the Imperial units so popular in North America,
          the phone app speaks metric!</li>
